<h2>Recommendations for "Botium Toys"</h2>
Based on the Controls and Compliance Checklist, multiple controls need to be implemented to improve "Botium Toys'" security posture and better ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information, including: Least Privilege, disaster recovery plans, password policies, separation of duties, an IDS, ongoing legacy system management, encryption, and a password management system.
<br />
<br />
To address the gaps in compliance, "Botium Toys" needs to implement controls such as Least Privilege, separation of duties, and encryption. The company also needs to properly classify assets, to identify additional controls that may need to be implemented to improve their security posture and better protect sensitive information.
